    As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.
    Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. There's only one man I've ever
    called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is
    a television actor.

  It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. No… but I'd like to be asked! He'll want
  to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I'm half
  machine. I'm a monster. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to
  oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with
  no secrets to hide.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
